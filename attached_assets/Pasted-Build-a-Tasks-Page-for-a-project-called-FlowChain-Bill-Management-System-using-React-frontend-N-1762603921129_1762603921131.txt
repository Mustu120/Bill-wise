Build a Tasks Page for a project called FlowChain – Bill Management System using React (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), and PostgreSQL (database).

Authentication is already implemented, so assume the logged-in user’s ID and name are available in session or context.
Design and layout should match a modern light theme dashboard with accent colors (purple/white), rounded cards, and tabbed sections.

🧭 Page Overview

The Tasks Page should have two main toggles at the top:

My Tasks — shows only tasks assigned to the logged-in user

All Tasks — shows every task in the system

Users should be able to:

View existing tasks in a simple board/list layout

Create a new task

Edit an existing task
Include a search bar at the top-right to filter tasks by title or tag.

➕ Create / Edit Task View

When the user clicks Create Task or Edit Task, show a form with the following fields:

Task Name: text input

Assignee: single-select dropdown (populated from users table)

Project: single-select dropdown (auto-fills if opened from a project view)

Tags: multi-select dropdown (comma-separated values)

Deadline: date selector

Image Upload: button to browse and upload an image file

Uploaded files go to /uploads folder on the server.

Save filename or URL in PostgreSQL under image_url column.

🗂 Tabs (below form)

Create three tab sections:

⿡ Description Tab — large text area for writing the task description.
⿢ Timesheets Tab — table structure with columns: Employee | Time Logged (hrs).

Add/remove rows dynamically.

Store data in timesheets table:

CREATE TABLE timesheets (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id INTEGER REFERENCES tasks(id),
  employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  time_logged NUMERIC
);


⿣ Task Info Tab — shows metadata:

Last change made by

Last modified date

Total working hours (auto-calculated or manual)

💾 Buttons and Actions

Save (Green) → save or update task via POST/PUT /api/tasks

Discard (Grey) → cancel and return to list

Buttons appear top-right of the form.

⚙ Backend (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL)

Use Express and pg to connect to PostgreSQL.
Database schema:

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  task_name VARCHAR(255),
  assignee_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  project_id INTEGER REFERENCES projects(id),
  tags TEXT[],
  deadline DATE,
  description TEXT,
  image_url TEXT,
  last_modified_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  last_modified_on TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  total_hours NUMERIC DEFAULT 0
);


API Endpoints:

GET /api/tasks → fetch all tasks (filter by current user if ?assignedTo=currentUserId)

GET /api/tasks/:id → fetch one

POST /api/tasks → create

PUT /api/tasks/:id → update

POST /api/upload → handle image upload (use multer)

GET /api/projects, GET /api/users → populate dropdowns

Use auth middleware to verify user session.

🧱 Frontend (React + Tailwind)

Components:

TasksPage.jsx — list view + toggles (My Tasks / All Tasks)

TaskForm.jsx — Create/Edit form + tabs

Sidebar.jsx — navigation

Tabs.jsx — reusable tabs (Description, Timesheets, Task Info)

TaskCard.jsx — display tasks

Use Axios for API calls and React Router for navigation.
Style with Tailwind CSS.
Optionally add Framer Motion for animations.

🧩 Deliverables

Functional Tasks page (list + create/edit)

Image upload support

PostgreSQL CRUD integration

Uses authenticated user for My Tasks filter

Responsive layout

💡 Example Flow

User logs in.

Opens Tasks → sees My Tasks / All Tasks.

Clicks Create Task → form opens.

Fills details, uploads image, adds description/timesheets.

Clicks Save → data stored in PostgreSQL.

Returns to updated task list.
